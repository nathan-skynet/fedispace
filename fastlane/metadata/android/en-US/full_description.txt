Fedispace is an application under development written with Flutter.
         It allows to connect to the Pixelfed federation.

         It lacks a lot of functionality but is being integrated. It uses push notifications without Google, i.e. UnifiedPush and (Gotify, NTFY).

         For everything that is question of graphic style I am open to any suggestions at  [https://git.echelon4.space/sk7n4k3d/fedispace/issues].

         Features:

         * <b> Dark mode </b> - because we can.
         * <b> No dependency on Google </b> - Firebase
         * <b> Ready for Push Notification with UnifiedPush backend </b> - Send notification with (NTFY, Gotify, Nextpush)
         * <b> beautiful UI Timeline under dev </b>
