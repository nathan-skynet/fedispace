# fedispace for Pixelfed Instance

Fedi Space is an application for Pixelfed.\
It allows you to share the posts of the users you follow and many other things that I will add as I learn Flutter\
The Fedi Space application is written in Dart for Flutter\
One of the main feature is the push notification that I plan to implement.
