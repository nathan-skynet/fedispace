# fedispace for Pixelfed Instance

Fedi Space is an application for Pixelfed.\
It allows you to share the posts of the users you follow and many other things that I will add as I learn Flutter\
The Fedi Space application is written in Dart for Flutter\
One of the main feature is the push notification that I plan to implement.

## Contribute


### ANYONE can contribute:

* If you have a phone with a camera (or an actual camera), you can contribute exercise photos. (These don't need to look particularly good. Even lower resolution living room shots are fine.)
* If you have a computer, you can turn exercise photos into low-poly versions using the FOSStriangulator app.
* If you know a different language, you can translate.
* If you notice a bug or want a new feature, create an issue report.
* If you have an Apple Developer account, you can release the app for iOS.
* UX designers can help design UX for new features.
* UI designers can help with visuals and animations.
* Developers can take on an issue and submit a merge request to solve it.
